# Maintenance
The dataset for smart contract maintenance issues. 

**List_All_Papers.xlsx:** This file contains all the papers selected from five search engines, i.e., ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Springer Online Library, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The source of the papers is listed. Besides, 19 papers are selected through snowballing. The source of these papers is related paper names. Two researchers identify whether a paper is valuable to find something related to smart contract maintenance, and their results can be found at P1-Result and P2-Result, respectively. If there are some differences, they discussed to find a final result. 

**Result_Open_Card_Sorting.xlsx:** This file records the process of finding maintenance-related issues from the selected 131 papers. The two researchers first read the papers and required to collect the data related to: , (1). What are the challenges / issues of smart contract maintenance? (2). What are the used maintenance methods? If we cannot find any answers from a paper, the paper is omitted from our list. The answers are recorded in the second (Answer to RQ1) and third (Answer to RQ2) column. After that,  the *Answer to RQ1* were first summarized into detailed maintenance issues (See the column "Level 1-RQ1"). Then, the detailed maintenance issues were clustered according to their maintenance types, e.g., corrective, adaptive, perfective maintenance (See the column "Level 2-RQ1").  For the *Answer to RQ2*, they were first grouped according to their checking types, e.g., off-line / on-line checking (See the column "Level 1-RQ2"). After that, they will be clustered into more detailed groups according to the technique they used, e.g., programming analysis or fuzzing (See the column "Level 2-RQ2"). 


**PaperList.txt:** This file contains the information of selected 131 papers. 

**Survey-English.pdf** and **survey-Chinese.pdf** are the survey of English and Chinese versions, respectively. **Survey-EN-Raw-Data.xlsx** and **Survey-CN-Raw-Data.xlsx** are the related raw data of the survey.
